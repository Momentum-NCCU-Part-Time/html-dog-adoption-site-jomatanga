        Happy Valley Shelter has been finding safe and loving homes for dogs in
        the Piedmont area since 1989. We work in cooperation with local county
        shelters and rescue organizations and specialize in caring for neglected
        and abandoned dogs.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Happy Valley, our staff are trained in all aspects of animal welfare
        and can give you expert advice on adoption, training, and care. We are
        proud of the work we do at Happy Valley and are grateful to our
        community for their support in helping us achieve our mission.
      </p>
      <p>
        We take great care in matching each dog with the right family to ensure
        a successful adoption. We believe that every dog deserves a loving home,
        and we work tirelessly to make that a reality.
